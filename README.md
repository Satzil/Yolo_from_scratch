<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains an implementation of a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model for German to English translation using Transformers in PyTorch. The project aims to provide a practical example of how to build a translation model using state-of-the-art Transformer architecture.</p>
<h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>
<p>The project consists of the following main components:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: German-English parallel corpus is used for training and evaluation. The dataset is preprocessed to tokenize and prepare input-output pairs for training the Seq2Seq model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Model Architecture</strong>: The Seq2Seq translation model is implemented using the Transformer architecture. This architecture consists of encoder and decoder layers with self-attention mechanisms, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Training</strong>:    The model is trained on the prepared dataset using the Adam optimizer with specific hyperparameters. The training process involves iterating over mini-batches of data and optimizing a cross-entropy loss function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to assess its translation performance. Metrics such as BLEU score are computed to measure the quality of translations generated by the model.</p>
</li>
</ol>
